#summary DELTA data set representations

A DELTA data set can be stored in one of two formats:
 * A set of text files containing DELTA directives. (http://delta-intkey.com/www/uguide.htm#_2._Characters_and)
 * A binary format used by the DELTA editor. (http://delta-intkey.com/www/delta-ed.htm)
The DELTA Editor program is able to convert between the two formats. 

In addition, the Intkey program contains a subset of the data set information in a binary format.

Internally, all formats are represented as an instance of a DeltaDataSet.
