== Installing the Open DELTA software ==

Releases of the DELTA software are available in the [http://code.google.com/p/open-delta/downloads/list Downloads] section of this web site.  

Currently we distribute the Open DELTA software as either a jar file (all platforms) or as an installer (Microsoft Windows only).  



== Windows ==

===If you have a Java 6 runtime environment installed===

 # Download and run OpenDelta-1.0-M1-Installer-NOJRE.exe

===If you do not have a Java 6 runtime environment installed or do not know if you have a Java 6 runtime installed===
 
 # Download and run OpenDelta-1.0-M1-Installer.exe 

== Other Platforms ==
You must have a Java 6 runtime environment installed on your computer.

_It is planned to distribute the software in a zipped format with scripts to run the various applications in a future release._
