== Installing the Open DELTA software ==

Releases of the DELTA software are available in the [http://code.google.com/p/open-delta/downloads/list Downloads] section of this web site.  

Currently we distribute the Open DELTA software as either a jar file (all platforms) or as an installer (Microsoft Windows only).  

It is planned to change the jar file distribute to a zipped format with scripts to run the various applications in a future release.

 # Download and run DeltaInstaller.exe
