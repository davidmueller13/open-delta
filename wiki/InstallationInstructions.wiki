== Installing the Open DELTA software ==

Releases of the DELTA software are available in the [http://code.google.com/p/open-delta/downloads/list Downloads] section of this web site.  

Currently we distribute the Open DELTA software as either a jar file (all platforms) or as an installer (Microsoft Windows only).  

If you have a Java 6 runtime environment installed, you can launch the application directly using Java Web Start by clicking [http://open-delta.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/jnlp/open-delta.jnlp HERE]  Please note it uses a self signed certificate so you will get a security warning dialog when running the application in this way.

An uninstallation wizard is provided on windows. The uninstallation wizard can be run by selecting _Uninstall Open DELTA Suite_ from the Windows
Start Menu under _All Programs/Open DELTA Suite_. It can also be run from the Control Panel under _Programs and Features_ or _Add/Remove Programs_
on earlier versions of Windows.
