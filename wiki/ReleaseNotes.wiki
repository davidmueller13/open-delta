= Milestone 1 =

The goals of milestone 1 of the Open DELTA project are:

 * To formally establish the project, including tool chain and build environment
 * To demonstrate and experiment with packaging and publishing options
 * Investigate and address some of the risk issues identified during the scoping exercise:
   * Java port of the slot file (`*`.dlt) backing store
   * RTF processing and editing
   * Context sensitive help system and "Tooltip" style assistance
   * Internationalization and Localization
   * Potential performance issues, including startup time, User Interface responsiveness and general processing performance.


For installation instructions see the [InstallationInstructions Installation Instructions].

*Please note:* Milestone 1 is an alpha release, and should not be used with production data. You should make a copy of your existing Delta data sets before opening them with this version.


== DELTA Editor ==

===New Features===

 * Existing .dlt files can be opened and viewed using the DELTA Editor. Both grid view and tree view attribute editors have been implemented.
 * Save and Save As are implemented
 * Simplified Chinese and Spanish languages. The current locale and language are taken from operating system settings, but can be overridden for demonstration purposes by supplying command line arguments when launching the jar file:
 To view Chinese captions, for example, launch the editor from the command line with the following command (assuming the jar file is in the current working directory):
{{{
   java -Duser.region=CN -Duser.language=zh -jar delta-editor-1.0-M1-with-dependencies.jar
}}}

 To view Spanish captions, use:
{{{
   java -Duser.region=ES -Duser.language=es -jar delta-editor-1.0-M1-with-dependencies.jar
}}}

*Note* Chinese and Spanish localisations have been chosen arbitrarily for demonstrative purposes. Please contact the project team should you be willing and able to contribute additional language translations.

 * Existing Taxon attributes can be edited, although state check boxes are currently read only
 * Help system (including context sensitive help) demonstration
 * Windows installer with or without a bundled Java Runtime Environment
 * Cross platform support.  Currently the application has been tested on Windows XP, Windows 7, Mac OS 10.6.6 (x86) and Ubuntu Linux.

===Bug Fixes===
 * Issue 1: 	Attached dlt file causes issues

===Known Problems===
 * The Save menu item is not enabled only when a file has been modified.
 * Features are still missing from read only mode, including Controlling/Controlled Attributes, Implicit values, Mandatory values.
