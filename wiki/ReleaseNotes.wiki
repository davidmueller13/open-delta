   * RTF processing and editing
   * Context sensitive help system and "Tooltip" style assistance
   * Internationalization and Localization

== DELTA Editor ==

===New Features===

 * Existing .dlt files can be opened and viewed using the DELTA Editor. Both grid view and tree view attribute editors have been implemented.
 * Save and Save As are implemented
 * Simplified Chinese language and Spanish. The current locale and language are taken from operating system settings, but can be overridden for demonstration purposes by supplying command line arguments when launching the jar file:
 To view Chinese captions, for example, launch the editor from the command line with the following command (assuming the jar file is in the current working directory):
{{{
   java -Duser.region=CN -Duser.language=zh -jar delta-editor-1.0-M1-jar-with-dependencies.jar
}}}

 To view Spanish captions, use:
{{{
   java -Duser.region=ES -Duser.language=es -jar delta-editor-1.0-M1-jar-with-dependencies.jar
}}}

 * Existing Taxon attributes can be edited, although state check boxes are currently read only
 * Help system (including context sensitive help) demonstration
 * Windows installer with or without a bundled Java Runtime Environment

===Bug Fixes===
 * Issue 1: 	Attached dlt file causes issues

 * The Save menu item is not enabled only when a file has been modified.
 * Features are still missing from read only mode, including Controlling/Controlled Attributes, Implicit values, Mandatory values.
