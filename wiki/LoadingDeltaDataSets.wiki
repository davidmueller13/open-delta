#summary How to load a data set from the file system.

A DELTA data set can be stored in one of two formats:
 * A set of text files containing DELTA directives. (http://delta-intkey.com/www/uguide.htm#_2._Characters_and)
 * A binary format used by the DELTA editor. (http://delta-intkey.com/www/delta-ed.htm)

The DELTA Editor program is able to convert between the two formats. 

Internally, both formats are represented as an instance of a DeltaDataSet. 

To create a DeltaDataSet from the binary format used by the DELTA Editor:

{{{

    String dataSet = "/path/to/dataset.dlt";

    DataSetRepository repository = new SlotFileRepository();
    MutableDataSet dataSet = repository.findByName(dataSet, null);

}}}

In this case the runtime type of the returned {{{MutableDataSet}}} will be a {{{SlotFileDataSet}}}.

To create a DeltaDataSet from the directive file format used by the DELTA Editor, the argument passed to the DataSetRepository findByName method can be one of two things:
 # The path to a directory containing the directives files.  In this case, the directory must contain files named specs, items and chars.  
 # The path to a directives file that includes the directives that specify the data set.  

{{{
    String dataSet = "/path/to/";

    DataSetRepository repository = new TextFileDataSetRepository();
    MutableDataSet dataSet = repository.findByName(dataSet, null);

}}}
