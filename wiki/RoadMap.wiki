#summary Proposed project release schedule

= Open DELTA Project Roadmap =

The release plan is to publish a series of monthly milestone (alpha) releases, each designated with an 'M' number, until the software is generally feature complete, at which time it will be considered in 'beta'. Once all open issues with beta releases have been addressed, the releases will be designated as Release Candidate (RC) until such time as the software is considered complete and stable, and designated as the Version 1.0 General Availability (GA) build.

*Note:* The following release schedule is provisional, and may deviate based on what is actually achieved each milestone.
