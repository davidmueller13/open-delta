    <title>The Tree View Attribute Editor</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1><a name="_The_grid-view_attribute"></a>The grid-view attribute editor</h1>

<p style="page-break-after: avoid;">This view is similar to that
    of a spreadsheet program. Here is an example.</p>

<p class="image"><img src="delta-ed_files/delta-ed-37.png" alt="sample.dlt - Attribute Edit (Grid)" border="0"></p>

<p>The upper pane of this view is a grid displaying the data
    matrix. The columns represent the characters of the data set and the rows
    represent the items. The cells of the matrix display the attribute corresponding
    to a given character (column) and item (row). For non-text characters, any
    comments are removed from the attribute before display. This allows more of the
    &#39;basic&#39; data to be displayed. When an attribute appears in grey text (as for
    many of the entries in the column for character 10 in the example), it
    indicates that the state shown is present implicitly, rather than by explicit
    encoding. A grey background, as for character 11 of most taxa in the example,
    indicates that the attribute is &#39;complex&#39; (see definition above) and can be
    edited or entered only in the complex-attribute editing pane. A focus rectangle
    indicates the currently selected attribute of the grid. Elements of the pane
    may be resized by dragging their boundaries in the column or row headings (the
    grey areas at the left and top).</p>

<p>Characters and items may be re-ordered by dragging a feature
    name or taxon name (that is, the grid&#39;s column or row headings, respectively)
    to the desired position. Dragging with the right mouse button either moves or
    copies the item (for rows) or character (for columns) &#8211; a popup menu offers the
    choice &#39;Move here&#39; or &#39;Copy here&#39;. Clicking the right mouse button opens a
    popup menu with options for inserting, modifying or deleting items or
    characters. Double-clicking (with the left mouse button) on a character name
    will open the character editor dialog. Double-clicking on an item name will
    open the item editor dialog.</p>

<p>To copy cells to the clipboard, select the cells you want,
    and choose &#39;Edit &gt; Copy&#39; from the main menu. Note that the keyboard shortcut
    is &#39;Ctrl+Ins&#39;, not the standard Windows &#39;Ctrl+C&#39;. The &#39;Paste&#39; option has not
    been implemented, but the clipboard can be pasted into other programs such as
    Excel or Word. When pasting into Excel, start a new sheet, select the whole
    sheet, and format the cells as text (otherwise DELTA codes containing a slash
    will be interpreted as dates). Select the top left cell, and paste.</p>

<p>There are &#39;Print&#39;, &#39;Print Preview&#39;, and &#39;Print Setup&#39;
    options in the &#39;File&#39; menu (in grid view only). If you want more control over
    the layout, you can copy part of the grid and paste it into a word processor or
    spreadsheet. In Word, paste into a table, or paste as text and then use &#39;Table
    &gt; Convert &gt; Text to Table&#39;.</p>

<p><a name="complexAttributeEditor"><i>The Complex-Attribute Editor (lower-left pane).</i></a>
    This pane is a rich edit control &#8211; that is, it
    allows display and editing of formatting marks. It contains the DELTA encoding
    for the currently selected item and character, using the traditional DELTA
    style. Angle brackets should appear around comments, but should <i>not</i> be placed around text attributes. A
    toolbar above the pane provides controls for rendering portions of the text in
    bold, italics, etc., and for undoing changes. Error checking is performed when
    the input focus leaves the edit control.</p>

<p><a name="stateListAttributeEditor"><i>The State List (bottom-right pane).</i></a>
    If the currently selected character is a text or
    numeric character, this pane contains only an icon denoting the character type,
    and the units of measurement (if applicable). If the currently selected
    character is a multistate character, it contains a list of the states of the
    character, with a check box next to each. The appearance and method of use of
    the check boxes is the same as in the character-tree pane. This pane is
    provided so that the codings may be viewed and edited when the character is not
    &#39;expanded&#39; in the character-tree pane.</p>
