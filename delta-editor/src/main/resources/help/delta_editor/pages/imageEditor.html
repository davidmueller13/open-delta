<h1><a name="_Images_Windows_and"></a>The Image Editor</h1>

<p style="page-break-after: avoid;">Character and taxon images are displayed in windows
    that are meant to closely resemble the appearance they have within Intkey.
    These images may have <i>overlays</i>
    superimposed upon them. The editor provides facilities for adding, modifying,
    and deleting these overlays. Here is an example of a character image, as
    displayed in the editor.</p>

<p class="image"><img src="delta-ed_files/delta-ed-46.png" alt="Character 6 overlays." border="0"></p>

<p>Note that the image window contains its own menu. The
    &#39;Subject&#39; menu item allows the user to go to a different image attached to the
    same taxon or character, based on the subject text of the image. The &#39;Control&#39;
    menu provides options for going on to the next or previous image associated
    with the current taxon or character, or for going on to the next taxon or
    character. The &#39;Window&#39; menu provides options for controlling how the image and
    its overlays are displayed, and for obtaining information about the image. </p>

<p>The image above contains examples of the basic different
    types of overlays: text boxes (which automatically become scrollable for large
    amounts of text), push buttons, and &#39;hotspots&#39;. Overlays are inserted,
    modified, or deleted by right clicking on the image or an existing overlay.
    This will cause a popup-menu to appear, as seen below.</p>

<p class="image"><img src="delta-ed_files/delta-ed-47.png" alt="Character 9 overlays and menus." border="0"></p>

<p>The range of overlay types that are available depends upon
    the type of image being viewed. All image types allow for the creation of &#39;OK&#39;
    and &#39;Cancel&#39; buttons, which can be used in Intkey to close the image window;
    and for the creation of general-purpose &#39;text&#39; overlays, which may contain any
    arbitrary text. Taxon images may also contain a text overlay to contain the
    name of the taxon, and a &#39;Notes&#39; button which, when clicked, will cause notes
    associated with the image to be displayed in a separate window. Similarly,
    character images may contain a &#39;feature&#39; text overlay, which displays the
    feature description of the character; and a &#39;Notes&#39; button which, when clicked,
    will cause the character notes associated with the character to be displayed.</p>

<p>Character images may contain several other types of overlay,
    depending on the character type. Images associated with multistate characters
    may contain &#39;state&#39; text overlays, which displays a state number and
    description. When used in Intkey, these overlays may be selected by the user to
    indicate the applicability of that state. The &#39;state&#39; overlays may also have
    one or more &#39;hotspots&#39; associated with them - regions of the underlying image
    that may also be used by an Intkey user to select the associated state.
    Similarly, images associated with numeric characters may contain selectable
    &#39;value&#39; overlays that contain a numeric value (or range of numeric values), and
    these may also have associated hotspots. Images for numeric characters may, in
    addition, contain an &#39;enter&#39; overlay in which an Intkey end-user may enter any
    value, and a &#39;units&#39; overlay which displays the character&#39;s units of
    measurement (if they have been defined).</p>

<p>The basic overlays for a character image can be inserted in
    a single step by selecting the option &#39;All usual overlays&#39;. This inserts the &#39;Feature
    description&#39; box, &#39;State&#39; boxes (for a multistate character) or &#39;Enter&#39; and &#39;Units&#39;
    boxes (for a numeric character), &#39;OK&#39; and &#39;Cancel&#39; buttons, a &#39;Notes&#39; button
    (if there are notes for the character), and a hotspot for each character state.</p>

<p>Once they have been created, overlays may be resized or
    repositioned by use of the mouse (or similar pointing device). Click on a
    overlay to select it. Its border will become thicker. (The innermost margin of
    this border corresponds to the border of the &#39;normal&#39; overlay window.) When the
    cursor is positioned over this border, it changes to a double-headed arrow,
    indicating that the overlay window may be re-sized by holding down the left
    mouse button and moving the mouse. (The &#39;OK&#39;, &#39;Cancel&#39;, and &#39;Notes&#39;
    push-buttons are exceptions to this - they may be moved but not resized.) To
    move the selected overlay window, but retain its size, position the cursor in
    the middle of the window and hold down the left mouse button. The cursor will
    change to a &#39;hand&#39;, and moving the cursor will move the window to a new
    position. An overlay may not be positioned beyond the boundaries of the image
    window. A &#39;selected&#39; overlay may be returned to its normal state by &#39;selecting&#39;
    another overlay, or by clicking on some portion of the image where there is no
    overlay.</p>

<p>Double-clicking the left mouse button within a &#39;selected&#39;
    overlay will open a dialog box for modification of the properties of the
    overlay. The dialog may also be opened by right-clicking on the overlay and
    selecting &#39;Edit overlay&#39; from the popup menu. A sample of such a dialog for a
    &#39;state&#39; overlay appears as show here.</p>

<p class="image"><img src="delta-ed_files/delta-ed-48.png" alt="Modify state dialog." border="0"></p>

<p>The four checkboxes along the left side of the dialog
    control aspects of how the text within the overlay will be displayed. A tick in
    the first checkbox indicates that the text should be centred (both vertically
    and horizontally) within its border. The default behaviour is for text to begin
    in the upper-left corner of its containing frame. Ticking the second checkbox
    indicates that any comments within the state description text should be
    displayed, with the surrounding angle brackets converted into parentheses. By
    default, comments are removed from the text. A tick in the third checkbox
    indicates whether the state description should be omitted entirely; the default
    behaviour is to display the state description text. The fourth checkbox
    indicates that the height of the frame containing the text should automatically
    be adjusted to contain an integral number of lines. By default, the text boxes
    may be of any height.</p>

<p>Any text entered in the &#39;Additional Text&#39; area of the dialog
    will be appended to the state description text. If the state description text
    is omitted entirely, the text entered here will be displayed instead.</p>

<p>In the central-right portion of the dialog are controls for
    viewing and modifying the position of the upper-left corner of the overlay (&#39;X&#39;
    and &#39;Y&#39;) and the overlay&#39;s width and height (&#39;W&#39; and &#39;H&#39;). These values are
    expressed in <i>image units</i>, not pixels;
    these are values in the range 0 to 1000, with a value of 1000 corresponding to
    the width or height of the entire image. However, if the &#39;Use Integral Height&#39;
    checkbox is ticked, the height value (&#39;H&#39;) is given in terms of lines of text.
    The upper-left corner of the image is always taken as the origin (0,0), with
    positive values to the right and downwards.</p>

<p>Note that changes made within this dialog do not take effect
    immediately. You must click either the &#39;Apply&#39; button or &#39;OK&#39; button (which
    also closes the dialog) for any changes to be applied. The dialogs for
    modifying other types of text overlays are quite similar to the &#39;state&#39; example
    shown here, and differ only in minor details. A corresponding dialog for
    &#39;button&#39; overlays allows only the button&#39;s position to be modified.</p>

<p>A slightly different dialog is available for editing the
    properties of hotspots. Here is an example.</p>

<p class="image"><img src="delta-ed_files/delta-ed-49.png" alt="'Modify hotspot' dialog." border="0"></p>

<p>At the top of this dialog, a pair of radio buttons is used
    to select whether the shape of the hotspot is rectangular or elliptical. To the
    right centre are controls for viewing and modifying the position and extent of
    the hotspot, just as for text overlays. To the left are controls that affect
    how the hotspot boundaries appear. By default, the hotspots are invisible to
    Intkey user, with only a change in cursor shape notifying them when the mouse
    passes over a hotspot. If the &#39;Pop up&#39; option is selected, the outline of the
    hotspot will become visible whenever the mouse passes over the hotspot or over
    any other hotspot or &#39;state&#39; overlay associated with the same state as the
    hotspot. The &#39;Use custom color&#39; option allows the designer to select the colour
    that should be used in drawing the outline of a pop-up hotspot. By default, the
    boundary lines are drawn by &#39;inverting&#39; the colours of the display. Note that
    &#39;inverting&#39; the colours a second time restores the original colours. Hence when
    hot-spot boundary lines drawn in this way exactly overlie one another, they
    disappear from view. If the use of a custom colour is selected, the colour to
    be used may be chosen from the dialog that appears when the &#39;Choose color&#39;
    button is clicked.</p>
