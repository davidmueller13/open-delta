/**
 * A DataSetTranslator is responsible for turning a DeltaDataSet into another format.
 * Translations are potentially triggered at three points in the directive processing procedure:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>when the CHARACTER LIST directive is encountered.  This will result in a call on the translateCharacters method.</li>
 *     <li>when the ITEM DESCRIPTIONS directive is encountered.  This will result in a call on the translateItems method.</li>
 *     <li>when the OUTPUT PARAMETERS directive is encountered.  This will result in one of more calls to the translateOutputParameter method.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Implementations are not required to handle each of these directives, if they do not support a particular translation
 * they should implement a method that does nothing.
