	<h2>Checking an identification</h2>
	<p>You should check your identification against the information
		that can be obtained by pressing the &quot;Information&quot; button,
		in the &quot;Taxa&quot; toolbar (top-right pane). The information
		usually includes full and diagnostic descriptions. A diagnostic
		description aims to distinguish the taxon from all the others, using
		only characters that have not already been used in the identification.
		Illustrations may also be available.</p>
	<p>If the descriptions or illustrations are inconsistent with the
		tentative identification, you can increase the &quot;error
		tolerance&quot;, by means of the &quot;Error tolerance&quot; button in
		the &quot;Characters&quot; toolbar (in the top-left pane). This allows
		a greater number of mismatches before taxa are eliminated, so some
		taxa that were previously in the &quot;Eliminated Taxa&quot; pane move
		to the &quot;Remaining Taxa&quot; pane. The identification process can
		then be continued exactly as before, until only a single taxon
		remains.</p>
	<p>Increasing the error tolerance may also be used directly to
		confirm or increase your confidence in a tentative identification.
		Continuing the identification after increasing the error tolerance
		should again lead to a single remaining taxon. This may or may not be
		the same as the original remaining taxon, but, in either case, it will
		be more strongly separated from the eliminated taxa, and so you can
		have more confidence in the result. The advantage of this method over
		using a diagnostic description is that you have full control over the
		extra characters used.</p>
	<p>In Advanced mode (see &quot;Help&quot; menu), an increased error
		tolerance can be used in conjunction with the &quot;Separate a given
		taxon&quot; button, which orders the available characters according to
		how well they separate a given taxon from the other remaining taxa.
		This can lead to a quicker confirmation or rejection of the tentative
		identification. If the extra information that you enter is
		inconsistent with the original identification, you should switch back
		to using the &quot;Best&quot; order.</p>
