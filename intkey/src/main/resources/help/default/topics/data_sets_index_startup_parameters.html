	<h2>Data-sets index and startup parameters</h2>
	<p>Data sets are normally selected from a dialog box, which the
		program displays on startup or when the New Data Set option of the
		&quot;File&quot; menu is invoked. The program generates this dialog
		box from a file INTKEY.IND which is normally in the same directory as
		the program. Entries in this file can be added or removed using Intkey
		dialog boxes which are automatically displayed at appropriate times.
		Also, the file can be edited with any text editor (e.g. Notepad, which
		is supplied with Windows).</p>
	<p>If there is a file INTKEY_.IND in the same directory as the
		program, the name of a data-set initialization file (usually
		INTKEY.INI or INTKEY.INK) is read from this file, and the data set is
		immediately loaded. This feature can be used to simplify the starting
		of an Intkey package on a CD-ROM.</p>
	<p>Some aspects of the program&quot;s behaviour on startup can be
		controlled by adding parameters to the shortcut target line, as
		follows. Press the Windows &quot;Start&quot; button. Select
		&quot;Settings&quot;. Select &quot;Taskbar&quot;; the &quot;Taskbar
		Properties&quot; dialog box appears. Select the &quot;Start Menu
		Programs&quot; tab. Press the &quot;Advanced&quot; button; an
		&quot;Exploring ...&quot; window appears. In the right-hand part of
		the window, double click on Programs, then double click on DELTA.
		Click the right mouse button on &quot;Intkey&quot;; a menu appears.
		Click on &quot;Properties&quot;; the &quot;Intkey Properties&quot;
		dialog box appears. Click on the &quot;Shortcut&quot; tab. Click near
		the end of the &quot;Target&quot; text box, and type in the required
		parameters, separated by blanks.
	<p>
	<p>The available parameters are as follows.
	<dl>
		<dt>filename</dt>
		<dd>Specifies the name of an initialization file (for example,
			C:\\ANGIO\\INTKEY.INI). The corresponding data set is then
			automatically loaded when the program starts, and the data-set
			selection box is not displayed.</dd>
		<dt>&#45;A</dt>
		<dd>Sets Advanced mode.</dd>
		<dt>
			&#45;G=<i>filename</i>
		</dt>
		<dd>Specifies the name of the (global) index file. The default is
			INTKEY.IND in the same directory as the program. You will need to use
			this option if Intkey is on a network drive for which you do not have
			write permission.</dd>
		<dt>
			&#45;H=<i>filename</i>
		</dt>
		<dd>Specifies the name of the &quot;Help&quot; file. The default
			is INTKEN.HIN in the same directory as the program.</dd>
		<dt>&#45;I</dt>
		<dd>Suppresses display of startup images.</dd>
		<dt>
			&#45;P=<i>filename</i>
		</dt>
		<dd>Specifies the name of a preferences file &#45; see help for
			the &quot;Preferences&quot; command. The default directory is the one
			containing the program.</dd>
		<dt>
			&#45;R=<i>filename</i>
		</dt>
		<dd>Specifies the name of the DELTA registration file. The
			default is DELTA.INI in the same directory as the program.</dd>
