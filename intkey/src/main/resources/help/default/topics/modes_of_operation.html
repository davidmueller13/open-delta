<h2>Modes of Operation</h2>
Intkey has two modes of operation: Normal and Advanced.
In Normal mode, the program is operated via the toolbars. Most of the menu system, many dialog-box buttons, and the command line are disabled. There are three toolbars: the main toolbar, just under the menu bar; the &quot;Characters&quot; toolbar, at the top of the &quot;Best/Available Characters&quot; (top-left) pane; and the &quot;Taxa&quot; toolbar, at the top of the &quot;Remaining Taxa&quot; (top-right) pane. The main toolbar is usually defined by the author of a data set, and invoked in the program&quot;s initialization file (usually INTKEY.INI or INTKEY.INK).
In Advanced mode, which is set by the &quot;Advanced Mode&quot; option of the &quot;File&quot; menu, the program can be operated via the toolbars, the menu system, or the command line.
The program works the same in both modes, with the following exceptions.
<ol>
<li>Different main-toolbar buttons may be available in the two modes, and buttons which look the same may have been defined differently (see &quot;Define&quot;).</li>
<li>In Normal mode, there are no &quot;Separate&quot; and &quot;Set match&quot; buttons in the &quot;Characters&quot; toolbar (top-left pane).</li>
<li>In Normal mode, the following keywords are not shown in keyword-selection dialogs: remaining, eliminated, selected, available, used.</li>
<li>In Normal mode, character images are automatically displayed during identification. In Advanced mode, you must press the &quot;Images&quot; button to display images. See &quot;Display Images&quot;.</li>
<li>In Normal mode, Autotolerance is off; in Advanced mode, it is on. See &quot;Set Autotolerance&quot;.</li>
