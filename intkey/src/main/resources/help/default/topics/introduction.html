	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Intkey is an interactive program for identifying a specimen by
		comparing it with stored descriptions. The program can also be used to
		interrogate the stored data.</p>
	<p>Intkey has two modes of operation: Normal and Advanced. We
		recommend that you start with Normal mode, even if you know how to use
		conventional identification keys.</p>
	<p>In Normal mode, the program is operated via the toolbars. Most
		of the menu system, many dialog-box buttons, and the command line are
		disabled.</p>
	<p>In Advanced mode, which is set by the &quot;Advanced Mode&quot;
		option of the &quot;File&quot; menu, the program can be operated via
		the toolbars, the menu system, or the command line. Before using this
		mode, you should become thoroughly familiar with Normal mode, and read
		the &quot;Introduction&quot; which becomes available upon entering
		Advanced mode.</p>
	<p>To display the Help for an active toolbar button (one that is
		not grey), first press the &quot;?&quot; button at the right of the
		main toolbar (which is just below the menu bar), then click on the
		button for which help is required. Basic instructions for using the
		program for identification are in the help for the &quot;Restart
		identification&quot; button. The author of a data set may also have
		supplied other help accessible via the leftmost button of the main
		toolbar.</p>
