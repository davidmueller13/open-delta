	<h2>The Command Line</h2>
	Intkey commands may be typed in on the &quot;command line&quot; at the
	bottom of the screen. Commands consist of a command word, or a command
	word followed by parameters. You can learn to use the command line by
	observing the commands which are built up by the program when you use
	the menu system. Command words and parameters may be abbreviated, as
	long as the abbreviations are not ambiguous (the program will tell you
	if they are). You can edit the command line by using the left and right
	arrow keys, and the Backspace, Delete, and Insert keys. If a keyword
	(q.v.) containing blanks is used on the command line, it must be
	enclosed in quotation marks ("), or the blanks must be omitted. All
	taxon names can be used as keywords on the command line. Commands may
	also be read from a file. See the &quot;File Input&quot; command for
	details.
