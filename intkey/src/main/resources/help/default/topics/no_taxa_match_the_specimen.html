	<h2>No Taxa Match the Specimen</h2>
	Your specimen does not completely match any of the taxa in the data
	set. This could be because: you have made errors in entering
	information about the specimen; there are errors in the data; or the
	taxon to which your specimen belongs is not in the data set. If you
	press the &quot;Allow mismatches&quot; button, taxa will not be
	eliminated unless they differ from the specimen in more than the
	indicated number of characters. This will allow you to continue the
	identification. The list of remaining taxa will show, in parentheses,
	the number of differences between the specimen and each taxon.
	Alternatively, you can alter some of the information you have already
	entered by clicking on the appropriate character in the &quot;Used
	Characters&quot; pane. The program again displays the box for selecting
	character states or entering values, and you can change the information
	you previously entered. You can also remove the character from the
	identification by clearing all the information. To deselect a
	previously selected state value, click on it again. If you think the
	identification is too badly wrong to be worth salvaging, press the
	&quot;Restart identification&quot; button to start afresh.
