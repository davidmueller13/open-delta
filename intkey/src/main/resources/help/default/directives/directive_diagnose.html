	<h2>DIAGNOSE</h2>
	<p>This command generates diagnostic descriptions of taxa. You may
		specify &quot;preset&quot; characters to be included in all the
		descriptions: specify NONE if you want the diagnostic characters to be
		selected entirely by the program. Each diagnostic description will (if
		possible) differ in at least DIAGLEVEL characters from the full
		description of every other INCLUDEd taxon (not just the taxa specified
		in this command) (see SET DIAGLEVEL, INCLUDE TAXA). The current MATCH
		setting (see SET MATCH) is ignored: the setting used is almost
		equivalent to O U I, but see SET DIAGTYPE. The characters are selected
		from the AVAILABLE characters (see Keywords). See also OUTPUT
		DIAGNOSE, DISPLAY CHARACTERORDER SEPARATE.</p>
