	<h2>FILE</h2>
	<p>This command specifies the names of input and output files, and
		causes input files to be read. If a specified output file already
		exists (that is, was present before the Intkey run) and the command
		came from the keyboard, a warning is given and there is an opportunity
		to abort the command; if the command came from an input file, the
		existing output file is overwritten without warning.</p>
	<p>
		<i>Syntax of command line:</i> FILE <i>option filename</i>
	</p>

	<h3>
		FILE INPUT <i>filename</i>
	</h3>
	<p>This command reads and executes a file of Intkey commands.
		Commands in an input file take the same form as commands entered
		interactively on the command line, or generated by the menus, except
		that they must be preceeded by a * (e.g. *SET), and the parameters may
		extend over more than one line. Each command must start on a new line.




	
	</li> To facilitate the location of errors in an input file, put a DISPLAY
	INPUT ON command at the start of the file.
	</p>

	<h3>
		FILE OUTPUT <i>filename</i>
	</h3>
	<p>This command specifies the name of a file to which output lines
		generated by the OUTPUT command will copied when the program
		terminates, or when a FILE CLOSE command is given. Up to 16 output
		files may be specified, and the same file may be specified more than
		once.</p>

	<h3>
		FILE LOG <i>filename</i>
	</h3>
	<p>This command specifies the name of a file to which the log (see
		DISPLAY LOG) will be saved when the program terminates. The command
		may be used at any time during a session. Log files are saved in RTF
		format if the specified file type is .rtf, and otherwise as plain
		text.</p>

	<h3>
		FILE JOURNAL <i>filename</i>
	</h3>
	<p>This command specifies the name of a file to which all input
		lines will be copied when the program terminates. See also DISPLAY
		INPUT.</p>

	<h3>
		FILE CLOSE <i>filename</i>
	</h3>
	<p>This command causes a file previously named in a FILE OUTPUT
		command to be output and closed.</p>

	<h3>
		FILE CHARACTERS <i>filename</i>
	</h3>
	<p>This command specifies the name of the Intkey characters file,
		and is normally used only in the initialization file, INTKEY.INI. If
		the command has not been specified by the time the program needs
		information from the data files, the name ICHARS is used.</p>
	<p>Intkey cannot be used to prepare or alter its characters file.
		This is done via the DELTA system &#45; see M.J. Dallwitz (1980),
		&quot;A general system for coding taxonomic descriptions&quot;, Taxon
		29, 41&#45;6.</p>

	<h3>
		FILE TAXA <i>filename</i>
	</h3>
	<p>This command specifies the name of the Intkey taxa (items) file,
		and is normally used only in the initialization file, INTKEY.INI. If
		the command has not been specified by the time the program needs
		information from the data files, the name IITEMS is used.</p>
	<p>Intkey cannot be used to prepare or alter its taxa file. This is
		done via the DELTA system &#45; see M.J. Dallwitz (1980), &quot;A
		general system for coding taxonomic descriptions&quot;, Taxon 29,
		41&#45;6.</p>

	<h3>
		FILE DISPLAY <i>filename</i>
	</h3>
	<p>This command displays the specified file in a separate window.</p>
