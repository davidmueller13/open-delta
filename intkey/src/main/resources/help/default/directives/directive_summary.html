	<h2>SUMMARY</h2>
	<p>This command displays a summary of the character values
		exhibited by the specified set of taxa, for the specified set of
		characters. The output line labelled &quot;U/I/Recorded&quot; gives,
		for each character, the numbers of taxa for which the character is
		unknown, inapplicable, or recorded. Multistate and integer numeric
		values are summarized as a &quot;distribution of values&quot;. Each
		value is followed by the number (in parentheses) of taxa which exhibit
		the value. If this number is the same for consecutive values of a
		character, the values are expressed as a range; note that this does
		not imply that the range occurs as such in any of the members of the
		set. Real numeric values are summarized as a &quot;mean&quot; and
		&quot;standard deviation&quot;. The standard deviation is calculated
		from the within-taxon means, that is, the variation within taxa is not
		included. If difficulties arise with interpretation of the output,
		comparison with DESCRIBE output may be helpful. See also OUTPUT
		SUMMARY, Keywords.</p>
