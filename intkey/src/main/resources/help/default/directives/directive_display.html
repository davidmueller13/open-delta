	<h2>DISPLAY</h2>
	<p>This command sets options for controlling the screen display.</p>
	<p>
		<i>Syntax of command line:</i> DISPLAY <i>option</i> <i>value</i>
	</p>

	<h3>
		DISPLAY CHARACTERORDER BEST<br />DISPLAY CHARACTERORDER NATURAL<br />DISPLAY
		CHARACTERORDER SEPARATE <i>t</i><br />
	</h3>

	<p>
		where <i>t</i> is a taxon number, or a keyword representing a single
		taxon.
	</p>
	<p>Causes the list of characters to be displayed in
		&quot;Best&quot; order, natural order, or the most appropriate order
		to &quot;Separate&quot; the specified taxon, respectively.</p>
	<p>In &quot;Best&quot; and &quot;Separate&quot; orders, the merit
		of a character is calculated partly from its separating power, and
		partly from its &quot;reliability&quot; or ease of use. Characters are
		displayed in order of merit, and their separating powers are shown at
		the left of the display. A separating power of 1 corresponds to a
		division of the group of remaining taxa into halves, and a value of 0
		indicates very poor separation. See Section 5.4 of the DELTA
		User&quot;s Guide for more details.</p>
	<p>See also SET RELIABILITIES, SET RBASE.</p>


	<h3>DISPLAY COMMENTS ON|OFF</h3>
	<p>Determines whether comments in taxon names are displayed in list
		boxes and in the output of the TAXA command. The default is OFF.</p>

	<h3>DISPLAY CONTINUOUS ON|OFF</h3>
	<p>When CONTINUOUS is ON, the main text display does not pause
		between &quot;pages&quot;, images are displayed in a continuous loop,
		and the &quot;Multiple Images&quot; option in taxon-image windows is
		unavailable. The default is OFF.</p>
	<h3>DISPLAY ENDIDENTIFY ON|OFF</h3>
	<p>When ENDIDENTIFY is ON, the commands specified by DEFINE
		ENDIDENTIFY are executed at the end of an identification. The default
		is ON for Normal mode, and OFF for Advanced mode.</p>

	<h3>DISPLAY IMAGES</h3>
	<p>
		<i>options</i>
	<ul>
		<li>where <i>options</i> are one of AUTO, MANUAL, and OFF, and/or
			one of MISSING_IMAGE_LIST, CHARACTER_IMAGE_LIST, and
			TAXON_IMAGE_LIST.</li>
		<li>When AUTO is set, images are displayed automatically after a
			state-selection menu is displayed; MANUAL cancels this option. OFF
			suppresses all references to images; this option is intended for use
			with data sets whose images have not been installed (for example,
			because of lack of disk space). The default is AUTO in Normal mode,
			and MANUAL in Advanced mode.</li>
		<li>The MISSING_IMAGE_LIST option checks local disks for the
			presence of all images, and lists missing ones (images on the
			Internet are not checked). The CHARACTER_IMAGE_LIST and
			TAXON_IMAGE_LIST options list the images which are linked to INCLUDEd
			characters or taxa (the <i>presence</i> of the images is not
			checked).</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>DISPLAY INAPPLICABLES ON|OFF</h3>
	<p>Determines whether inapplicable characters are displayed in the
		output of the DESCRIBE command. The default is ON.</p>

	<h3>DISPLAY INPUT ON|OFF</h3>
	<p>Determines whether the contents of an input file are displayed
		(and included in the LOG and JOURNAL files) as it is executed (see
		FILE INPUT). The default is OFF.</p>

	<h3>DISPLAY KEYWORDS ON|OFF</h3>
	<p>If KEYWORDS is OFF, the display does not pause at keyword menus,
		but immediately displays the default character or taxon menu. The
		default is OFF in Normal mode, and ON in Advanced mode.</p>

	<h3>DISPLAY LOG ON|OFF</h3>
	<p>Determines whether the log window is displayed. The default is
		OFF.</p>

	<h3>DISPLAY NUMBERING ON|OFF</h3>
	<p>Determines whether taxon and character numbers are displayed in
		some contexts. The default is OFF.</p>

	<h3>DISPLAY SCALED ON|OFF</h3>
	<p>DISPLAY SCALED ON causes taxon images to be automatically scaled
		to fit within the image window. DISPLAY SCALED OFF turns this option
		off. The default is ON.</p>

	<h3>DISPLAY UNKNOWNS ON|OFF</h3>
	<p>Determines whether unknown characters are displayed in the
		output of the DESCRIBE command. The default is ON.</p>

	<h3>DISPLAY WINDOWING ON|OFF</h3>
	<p>Determines whether output is displayed in separate windows. The
		default is ON.</p>
