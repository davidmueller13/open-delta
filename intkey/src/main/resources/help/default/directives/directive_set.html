	<h2>SET</h2>
	<p>Sets the values of various parameters.</p>
	<p>
		<i>Syntax of command line:</i> SET <i>parameter value</i>
	</p>

	<h3>SET AUTOTOLERANCE ON|OFF</h3>
	<p>When AUTOTOLERANCE is ON, then TOLERANCE (see SET TOLERANCE) is
		decreased automatically by the program to the smallest value such that
		the number of taxa remaining is non-zero; the value is never
		automatically increased. The default is ON in Normal mode, and OFF in
		Advanced mode. See also SET EXACT.</p>

	<h3>SET DEMONSTRATION ON|OFF</h3>
	<p>When DEMONSTRATION is ON, the RESTART command restores the SET,
		DISPLAY, and INCLUDE parameters to the values they had when
		demonstration mode was turned on, or the values associated with the
		selected operation mode (automatic or manual).</p>
	<p>When DEMONSTRATION is turned ON from an input command file it
		cannot subsequently be turned OFF except from another input file.</p>
	<p>This option is intended for running unattended demonstrations of
		the program. The default is OFF.</p>

	<h3>
		SET DIAGLEVEL <i>n</i>
	</h3>
	<p>Sets the required level of diagnostic descriptions (see
		DIAGNOSE). Each diagnostic description will (if possible) differ in at
		least DIAGLEVEL characters from the full description of every other
		INCLUDEd taxon. The default value is 1.</p>

	<h3>SET DIAGTYPE SPECIMENS|TAXA</h3>
	<p>Specifies whether DIAGNOSE will generate specimen- or
		taxon-diagnostic descriptions. A specimen-diagnostic description must
		be able to distinguish any specimen belonging to the diagnosed taxon
		from any specimen belonging to any other taxon. A taxon-diagnostic
		description must be able to distinguish the diagnosed taxon from any
		other taxon. When generating specimen-diagnostic descriptions, the
		program will not include characters which may be inapplicable to
		specimens in the diagnosed taxon, because, for some specimens, such
		characters cannot contribute to the desired separation. The default is
		SPECIMENS.</p>

	<h3>
		SET EXACT <i>c</i> <sub>1</sub> <i>c</i> <sub>2</sub> ...
	</h3>
	<p>
		where <i>c</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>c</i><sub>2</sub> ... are character
		numbers, ranges or keywords.
	</p>
	<p>Specifies characters which are to be regarded as not subject to
		error. When such a character is USEd, taxa inconsistent with the
		specified value are eliminated, regardless of the TOLERANCE value.
		Furthermore, any intra-taxon variability inconsistent with the
		specified value is subsequently ignored, and does not appear in
		descriptions.</p>
	<p>See also Keywords.</p>

	<h3>SET FIX ON|OFF</h3>
	<p>SET FIX ON fixes the attributes that have currently been USEd,
		so that they are not cleared by the RESTART command. SET FIX OFF
		cancels the SET FIX ON command: fixed characters are cleared and the
		identification is restarted.</p>

	<h3>
		SET IMAGEPATH <i>path</i>
	</h3>
	<p>Specifies the directory path which will be searched for the
		character and taxon images. The default is the current directory.
		Example: SET IMAGEPATH .;IMAGES;B:\\ will cause the program to search
		for images in the current directory, its subdirectory IMAGES, and the
		root directory of the B drive. Components of the imagepath may be
		URL&quot;s, e.g. http://biodiversity.uno.edu/delta/angio/images.</p>
	<li>See also ILLUSTRATE.</li>

	<h3>
		SET INFOPATH <i>path</i>
	</h3>
	<p>Specifies the directory path which will be searched for files
		specified in the INFORMATION dialog. The default is the current
		directory. Example: SET INFOPATH .;INFO;B:\\ will cause the program to
		search for files in the current directory, its subdirectory INFO, and
		the root directory of the B drive. Components of the infopath may be
		URL&quot;s, e.g. http://biodiversity.uno.edu/delta/angio/info.</p>

	<h3>
		SET MATCH <i>option1 option2</i> ...
	</h3>
	<p>
		where <i>option1</i>, <i>option2</i>, ... are chosen from Overlap,
		Subset, Exact, Unknowns, and Inapplicables.
	</p>
	<p>Specifies which character values are to be regarded as equal
		&#45; that is, &quot;match&quot; &#45; in the commands USE,
		DIFFERENCES, or SIMILARITIES.</p>
	<p>SET MATCH O specifies that two sets of values match if they
		overlap, that is, if they have any values in common (e.g. 1/2 matches
		2/3; 2&#45;5 matches 4&#45;10). (S and O cannot be used together.)</p>
	<p>SET MATCH S specifies that two sets of values match if one set
		(usually the values of the specimen) is a subset of the other. (E.g.
		1/2 matches 1/2/4 but not 2/3; 2&#45;5 matches 1&#45;6 but not
		4&#45;10).</p>
	<p>SET MATCH E specifies that two sets of values match only if they
		are identical.</p>
	<p>SET MATCH U specifies that &quot;unknown&quot; matches any
		value.</p>
	<p>SET MATCH I specifies that &quot;inapplicable&quot; matches any
		value.</p>
	<p>The default setting is O U I, which is usually the most
		appropriate for identification. For information retrieval, the most
		appropriate setting is usually O.</p>
	<p>The U and I settings do not affect text characters, for which
		unknown and inapplicable attributes are never treated as matches.</p>
	<p>N.B. Regardless of the current &quot;Match&quot; settings, the
		&quot;Differences between the specimen and the remaining taxa&quot;
		button always uses settings equivalent to &quot;Match exact&quot;, and
		the &quot;Differences between taxa&quot; button always uses settings
		equivalent to &quot;Match Unknowns Inapplicables&quot;. To obtain
		differences in terms of the current &quot;Match&quot; settings, use
		the &quot;Differences&quot; option in the &quot;Queries&quot; menu.</p>

	<h3>
		SET RBASE <i>r</i>
	</h3>
	<p>
		where <i>r</i> is a real number in the range 1 to 5. Sets the base of
		the logarithmic character-reliability scale, which is used in
		determining the &quot;best&quot; characters during an identification.
		The default value is 1.1. A value of 1 causes character reliabilities
		to have no effect on character merit. See Section 5.4 of the DELTA
		User&quot;s Guide for more details.

		VARYWT.</p>

	<h3>
		SET RELIABILITIES <i>c</i> <sub>1</sub>, <i>v</i> <sub>1</sub> <i>c</i>
		<sub>2</sub>, <i>v</i> <sub>2</sub> ...
	</h3>
	<p>
		where <i>c</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>c</i><sub>2</sub> ... are character
		numbers, ranges or keywords, and <i>v</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>v</i><sub>2</sub>,
		... are reliability values in the range 0 to 10. The values and their
		preceding commas are optional.
	</p>
	<p>Specifies character reliabilities, which are used in determining
		the &quot;best&quot; characters for separating taxa.</p>
	<p>If character numbers, ranges, or keywords are entered without
		following commas and values, the program prompts for a value, which is
		applied to all the specified characters.</p>
	<p>The default reliabilities are those that were specified when the
		Intkey data files were generated. See Sections 3.6 and 5.4 of the
		DELTA User&quot;s Guide for more details.</p>

	<h3>
		SET STOPBEST <i>n</i>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Specifies the number of characters which a DIAGNOSE command must find
		before it stops searching for acceptable characters. Characters are
		processed in order of decreasing reliability. If <i>n</i> is 0, which
		is the default, all the characters are examined.
	</p>

	<h3>SET TOLERANCE
	<i>n</i></h3>
	<p>Sets the maximum number of differences between a taxon and the
		specimen which still allows the taxon to remain under consideration in
		an identification. The default value is 0.</p>
	<p>If AUTOTOLERANCE is ON (see SET AUTOTOLERANCE), then TOLERANCE
		is altered automatically by the program to the smallest value such
		that the number of taxa remaining is non-zero. Regardless of the
		AUTOTOLERANCE setting, TOLERANCE is reset to 0 by the RESTART command.</p>

	<h3>SET VARYWT
	<i>r</i></h3>
	<p>where <i>r</i> is a real number in the range 0 to 1. Sets the
		value of a parameter which determines the treatment of intra-taxon
		variability in selecting the &quot;best&quot; characters during an
		identification. The default value is 1. If VARYWT is 1, there is no
		special penalty for intra-taxon variability; if it is 0, characters
		with intra-taxon variability are ranked lowest. See Section 5.4 of the
		DELTA User&quot;s Guide for more details.</p>
