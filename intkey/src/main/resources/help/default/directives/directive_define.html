	<h2>DEFINE</h2>
	<p>This command defines the following entities.
	<ul>
		<li>Keywords. These are names representing sets of characters or
			taxa (see Keywords in the general help).</li>
		<li>Toolbar buttons. The command associates Intkey commands with
			a button.</li>
		<li>Intkey commands to be executed at the end of an
			identification. The commands are executed only if DISPLAY IMAGES AUTO
			is set. N.B. This feature was designed for use with older versions of
			Intkey. We recommend against using it with the current version, as it
			usually obscures other important information which the program
			displays at the end of an identification.</li>
		<li>Intkey commands to be executed as part of the INFORMATION
			command.</li>
		<li>Words or phrases to be used for selection of taxon images by
			subject.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Syntax of command line &#45; keywords:</h3>
	DEFINE CHARACTERS
	<i>keyword</i>
	<i>c</i>
	<sub>1</sub>
	<i>c</i>
	<sub>2</sub> ...
	<br /> DEFINE TAXA
	<i>keyword</i>
	<i>t</i>
	<sub>1</sub>
	<i>t</i>
	<sub>2</sub> ...
	<br /> DEFINE NAMES
	<i>keyword</i>
	<i>n</i>
	<sub>1</sub>,
	<i>n</i>
	<sub>2</sub>, ...
	</p>
	where
	<i>c</i>
	<sub>1</sub>,
	<i>c</i>
	<sub>2</sub> ... are character numbers, ranges or previously defined
	keywords,
	<i>t</i>
	<sub>1</sub>,
	<i>t</i>
	<sub>2</sub> ... are taxon numbers, ranges or previously defined
	keywords, and
	<i>n</i>
	<sub>1</sub>,
	<i>n</i>
	<sub>2</sub> ... are taxon names. Taxon names must be separated by a
	comma or the end of a line. If the keyword contains spaces, it must be
	enclosed in quotation marks ("). If a keyword is defined in terms of a
	previously defined keyword, the meaning of the new keyword is fixed at
	the time of its definition &#45; that is, it is not affected by
	subsequent changes in the meaning of the previously defined keyword.
	The NAMES form of the command is mainly intended for use in INPUT
	files.
	<h3>Examples</h3>
	<p>
		<i>DEFINE CHARACTERS "reproductive organization" 12 23&#45;24<br />
			RESTART<br /> USE 13,2 27,1<br /> DEFINE TAXA g1 remaining</i>
	</p>
	<p>The keyword &quot;g1&quot; continues to represent those taxa
		with attributes &quot;13,2 27,1&quot;, even though the set of taxa
		represented by the keyword &quot;remaining&quot; may change later in
		the session.</p>
	<i>DEFINE NAMES cereals Echinochloa, Eleusine, Oryza, Panicum, Zea</i>
	<h3>Syntax of command line &#45; buttons</h3>
	<p>
		DEFINE BUTTON <i>switches</i> <i>bitmap</i>.BMP " <i>c</i> <sub>1</sub>;
		<i>c</i> <sub>2</sub>; ..." " <i>shorthelp</i>" " <i>fullhelp</i>" </br>
		DEFINE BUTTON CLEAR </br> DEFINE BUTTON SPACE
	</p>
	<p>
		where <i>bitmap</i>.BMP is the image to be displayed on the button, <i>c</i>
		<sub>1</sub>, <i>c</i> <sub>2</sub>, ... are commands, <i>shorthelp</i>
		is a short help message (&quot;hint&quot;) for the button, and <i>fullhelp</i>
		is detailed help for the button (optional). The buttons are added to
		the toolbar in the order in which they are defined.
	</p>
	<p>The optional switches are as follows.
	<ul>
		<li>/A displays the button only in Advanced mode.</li>
		<li>/N displays the button only in Normal mode.</li>
		<li>/U makes the button inactive (grey) unless there are USED
			characters.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>The special parameters &quot;?&quot;, &quot;?K&quot;,
		&quot;?L&quot;, and &quot;?L1&quot; can be used in place of
		predetermined sets of taxa or characters in the commands invoked by
		the button. They cause an appropriate dialog box to be displayed, so
		that the user can make a selection. &quot;?&quot; causes the default
		dialog box to be displayed (keyword or character/taxon selection
		depending on the DISPLAY KEYWORDS setting). &quot;?K&quot; causes the
		keyword selection dialog box to be displayed. &quot;?L&quot; causes
		the character or taxon selection dialog box to be displayed.
		&quot;?L1&quot; is applicable only to taxa. It has the same effect as
		&quot;?L&quot;, except that the dialog is not displayed if it would
		contain only a single taxon &#45; that taxon is automatically
		selected.</p>
	<p>DEFINE BUTTON CLEAR clears all the buttons, and DEFINE BUTTON
		SPACE puts a space between buttons.</p>
	<p>
		Example:</br> <i>DEFINE BUTTON START.BMP "INCLUDE TAXA CEREALS;
			RESTART" "Start a new identification, including only cereals"<br />
			DEFINE BUTTON /U CHANGE.BMP "CHANGE ?L" "Change previously entered
			information about the specimen being identified" "This button allows
			you to change previously entered information about the specimen being
			identified." </i>
	</p>
	<h3>Syntax of command line &#45; end of identification</h3>
	<p>N.B. This feature was designed for use with older versions of
		Intkey. We recommend against using it with the current version, as it
		usually obscures other important information which the program
		displays at the end of an identification.</p>
	<p>
		DEFINE ENDIDENTIFY <i>switch</i> " <i>c</i> <sub>1</sub>; <i>c</i> <sub>2</sub>;
		..."
	</p>
	<p>
		where <i>c</i> <sub>1</sub>, <i>c</i> <sub>2</sub>, ... are commands.
		The optional switch /T= <i>n</i> causes the output to be produced in <i>n</i>
		tiled windows.
	</p>
	<p>
		Example:<br /> <i>DEFINE ENDIDENTIFY "DESCRIBE REMAINING BRIEF"</i>
	</p>
	<h3>Syntax of command line &#45;information</h3>
	<p>
		DEFINE INFORMATION " <i>s</i>" " <i>c</i>"
	</p>
	<p>
		where <i>s</i> is the subject to be displayed in the INFORMATION
		dialog, and <i>c</i> is an Intkey command. The subjects are added to
		the list box in the dialog in the order in which they are defined, and
		after any subjects which were defined when the Intkey data files were
		generated. The special parameter &quot;?S&quot; should be used in
		place of a set of taxa in the command <i>c</i>. It means &quot;the
		taxon currently selected in the INFORMATION dialog&quot;.
	</p>
	<p>
		Example: <i>DEFINE INFORMATION "Diagnostic description" "diagnose
			?S none"</i>
	</p>
	<h3>Syntax of command line &#45; subjects</h3>
	<p>
		DEFINE SUBJECTS <i>w<sub>1</sub> </i> <i>w<sub>2</sub> </i> ...
	</p>
	<p>
		where <i>w<sub>1</sub> </i>, <i>w<sub>2</sub> </i>, ... are words, or
		phrases enclosed in quotation marks ("). The words or phrases are
		placed in the &quot;Subjects&quot; list box in the &quot;Select
		Multiple Images&quot; dialog box, which is invoked by the
		&quot;Multiple Images&quot; option of the &quot;Control&quot; menu in
		taxon-image windows. The images displayed are restricted to those
		whose &quot;subjects&quot; contain any of the words or phrases
		selected in the list box.
	</p>
	<p>
		Example:<br /> <i>DEFINE SUBJECTS anatomy "distribution map"
			"habit " habitat inflorescence type</i>
	</p>
	<p>The space in "habit " prevents it from matching
		&quot;habitat&quot; in a subject. "type" matches &quot;holotype&quot;
		and &quot;isotype&quot;, but " type" would not.</p>
