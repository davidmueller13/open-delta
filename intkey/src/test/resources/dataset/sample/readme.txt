Downloading Files via Ftp

Files must be downloaded in binary mode.

For identification and information retrieval, you need data files and the
program Intkey.

The data files are in the self-expanding file sample.exe. Download this file
into any directory (folder), and then run it to extract the data files.

Images for (optional) use with Intkey are available in the subdirectory
`images' of the current directory. The images should be placed in a
subdirectory `images' of the directory in which you placed the Intkey data
files.

To obtain Intkey, move to the parent directory (`..') of the current
directory, then move to the directory win32. Download the file intk32.exe
into any directory, then run it to install Intkey.
