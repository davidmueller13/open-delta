Synonyms

#1. Including <synonyms: ‘genera’ included in the current description>/
The data would be improved by inclusion of nomenclatural references. At present,
they are given only for genera not covered by Clayton and Renvoize (1986).

#2. <Mature> culms <maximum height: data unreliable for large genera>/
       cm high/

#3. Culms <whether woody or herbaceous>/
       1. woody and persistent/

#4. <Longevity of plants>/
       1. annual <or biennial, without remains of old sheaths or culms>/
       2. perennial <with remains of old sheaths and/or culms>/
‘Annual’: plants progressing from germination to seed production and perishing,
within that period.
‘Biennial’ (not known in grasses?): a plant normally requiring two years to
complete its life-cycle, growing vegetatively in the first, then flowering,
fruiting and perishing in the second.
‘Perennial’: a plant which persists and continues growth for several to many
years. Detectable in herbaceous grasses by the shrivelled remnants of old
sheaths and culms.

Photosynthetic pathway, leaf blade anatomy

#68. <Maximum cells-distant count; reliably indicative of photosynthetic
          pathway>/
       1. <showing a maximum cells-distant count of one, reliably predicting>
          C4/
       2. <showing a maximum cells-distant count of two or more, reliably
          predicting> C3/
‘Maximum cells-distant count’: the maximum number of cells separating any
individual chlorenchymatous mesophyll or photosynthetic carbon assimilation
(PCA) cell from the nearest parenchymatous bundle sheath (PBS) or photosynthetic
carbon reduction (PCR) cell. This parameter defines the relatively unambiguous
‘one cell distant criterion’, whereby C3 and C4 forms are reliably and easily
distinguished. By contrast, C3/C4 assignments by ‘radiateness’ of chlorenchyma,
or by recognition of ‘Kranz’/‘non-Kranz’ anatomy, are less satisfactory:
‘radiateness’ is ambiguous and is often misleading, and many C4 leaves
(Arundinella, Triodia etc.) do not exhibit typical ‘Kranz’ anatomy.
The terms PCA (primary carbon assimilation) and PCR (photosynthetic carbon
reduction: containing Rubisco) are applicable to the cells and tissues of C4
forms only. For these, the term PCR is preferable to ‘Kranz’, since it is
directly indicative of physiological function, and PCR cells do not always occur
in ‘Kranz’ bundle sheaths.
For detailed discussion, see Hattersley and Watson (1975) and Hattersley et al.
(1977).

#69. <C4> biochemical type <as determined by enzyme assay>/
       1. PCK/
       2. NAD–ME/
       3. NADP–ME/
See Hatch and Kagawa 1974, Gutierrez et al. 1974(a) and 1974(b), Hatch, Kagawa
and Craig 1975, and Prendergast, Hattersley and Stone 1987. Species samples in
parentheses.

#70. <Leaf blade XyMS: reliably indicative of C4 type>/
       1. XyMS+ <C3, or C4 ‘aspartate formers’ type PCK or NAD–ME (exceptions:
          Eriachneae)>/
       2. XyMS– <C4 ‘malate formers’, type NADP–ME>/
Refers to the presence (XyMS+) or absence (XyMS–) of cells between the metaxylem
vessel elements and laterally adjacent chlorenchymatous bundle sheath (CBS,
‘Kranz’ or PCR: C4) or parenchymatous bundle sheath (PBS: C3) cells in the
primary lateral vascular bundles (i.e. in the largest bundles exhibiting both
metaxylem and protoxylem) of the leaf blade (see Hattersley and Watson 1976).
When properly applied, this unambiguous criterion reliably distinguishes NADP-ME
species (XyMS–) from PCK and NAD-ME species (both XyMS+). The terms MS (mestome
sheath) and PS (parenchymatous sheath) of Brown (1975, 1977) refer to the
supposed homologies of photosynthetic carbon reduction (PCR, ‘Kranz’) sheaths in
C4 forms. The MS condition is identified by XyMS–, the PS one by XyMS+. Dengler
et al. (1985) provide comparative ontological evidence in support of the MS/PS
hypothesis.
For recent detailed discussion of C4 anatomical tissue configurations and
physiological types, see Hattersley (1992) and Hattersley and Watson (1993).

The phytogeographical Kingdoms, Subkingdoms, Regions and Subregions are those of
Takhtajan (1969). The data, which are complete, were provided by B.K. Simon
(1987). They are intended to reflect ‘natural’ distributions, insofar as these
are determinable.


Anatomical references

#87. <Leaf anatomical references>/
‘This project’ denotes original observations by Watson, or for Pooideae by
Macfarlane (1979) supplemented by Watson. Taxonomic realignments (extensive in
Triticeae) have been accounted for when using Metcalfe (1960).
