	<h2>USE</h2>
	<p>This command is no longer available in the menus, but is
		retained for use in the command line.</p>
	<p>The command allows the user to enter information about a
		specimen, in terms of characters selected according to categories
		(e.g. leaves, fruit, inflorescence, &quot;available&quot; &#45; see
		Keywords). After the characters have been selected, the program
		prompts for the character value(s) exhibited by the specimen.
		Character values can be changed at any stage by specifying the
		character in a CHANGE command or another USE command, and characters
		can be completely removed from the specimen description by means of
		the DELETE command. The characters currently in use are represented by
		the keyword USED (see Keywords). These characters, and the values that
		have been entered for them, are displayed in the main window, and can
		be displayed again by entering DESCRIBE SPECIMEN USED.</p>
	<p>
		<i>Syntax of command line:</i> USE <i>switch</i> <i>c</i><sub>1</sub>,<i>v</i><sub>1</sub>
		<i>c</i><sub>2</sub>,<i>v</i><sub>2</sub> ...
	</p>
	<p>
		where <i>c</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>c</i><sub>2</sub>, ... are character
		numbers, ranges, or keywords, and <i>v</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>v</i><sub>2</sub>,
		... are state values (or numerical or text values, depending on the
		character type). The state values and the preceding commas are
		optional; if they are not specified, the program prompts for them.
	</p>
	<p>The optional switch /M suppresses the warning message when
		characters that have already been used are specified.</p>
	<p>
		The command-word (&quot;USE&quot;) is optional (unless <i>c</i> <sub>1</sub>
		is a keyword): any input line starting with a number is assumed to be
		a USE command. Examples:
	<ul></ul>
	<li>17</li>
	<li>USE 3 10&#45;12</li>
	<li>USE lemmas</li>
	<li>4,1 7,2&#45;4/7 26,1.2&#45;2.6 biochemistry,1/2 104,tundra</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&quot;/&quot; indicates alternative values (&quot;or&quot;), and
		&quot;&#45;&quot; indicates a range of values (&quot;to&quot;). If the
		value of a text character contains spaces, it must be enclosed in
		quotation marks (").</p>
	<p>Example:
	<ul>
		<li>104,"disturbed ground"</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Blanks may be used in text values to control matching of parts
		of words; for example, " tropical" will match &quot;tropical&quot; and
		&quot;tropically&quot; but not &quot;subtropical&quot;.</p>
	<p>A value consisting of a single blank is treated as a special
		case. It matches any text recorded in the data, even text without
		blanks.</p>
	<p>Several strings separated by &quot;/&quot; may be specified for
		text characters. If MATCH is set to E or S, every string must be
		present to constitute a match; if MATCH is set to O, the presence of
		any of the strings is sufficient. Example:
	<ul>
		<li>1,"poa/agrostis"</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The MATCH U and I settings do not affect text characters, for
		which unknown and inapplicable attributes are never treated as
		matches. See also SET MATCH, SET FIX, SET EXACT, Keywords.</p>
