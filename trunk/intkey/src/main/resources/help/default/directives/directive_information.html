	<h2>INFORMATION</h2>
	<p>This command displays various information about selected taxa.
		After a taxon or set of taxa have been selected in the usual way, a
		dialog is displayed. This allows the further selection of a single
		taxon (if more than one was originally specified), and the selection,
		by subject, of the information to be displayed for the currently
		selected taxon. The dialog remains open, allowing the selection and
		display of further information, until explicitly closed or a command
		which potentially changes the number of taxa remaining, is executed.</p>
	<p>The kinds of information which may be displayed are as follows:
		(1) output of other commands such as DESCRIBE and DIAGNOSE; (2)
		images; (3) RTF files; (4) Intkey startup/initialization files (.ink);
		(5) any other external files with a registered type (i.e. for which a
		viewer is known to Windows, for example, HTML files, Word documents,
		Windows help files). The generation of output by means of other Intkey
		commands is specified by the Intkey command DEFINE INFORMATION. The
		other kinds of information are specified when the Intkey data files
		are generated by the author &#45; see directives TAXON IMAGES and
		TAXON LINKS in the DELTA User&quot;s Guide for details.</p>
	<p>The &quot;Web Search&quot; button in the &quot;Information&quot;
		dialog can be used to search for the selected taxon using a nominated
		general-purpose search engine (e.g. Google) or taxonomic database
		(e.g. ITIS). The queries sent to the search engines are normally
		specified in a file websearch.ind, which is supplied with Intkey. If
		you want specify your own set of queries and avoid having them
		overwritten when new versions of Intkey are installed, put them in a
		file mywebsearch.ind; Intkey will use this instead of websearch.ind.</p>
	<p>The SET INFOPATH command allows specification of the path to be
		searched for &quot;information&quot; files.</p>

		<i>Syntax of command line:</i> INFORMATION <i>switches</i> <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>
		<i>t</i><sub>2</sub> ...
	</p>
	<p>
		where <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>t</i><sub>2</sub> ... are taxon
		numbers, ranges or keywords.
	</p>
	<p>The optional switches are as follows.
	<ul>
		<li>/I=<i>text</i> causes the display of all images which are
			attached to the currently selected taxon, and whose subjects contain
			&quot;<i>text</i>&quot;. If &quot;=<i>text</i>&quot; is omitted, all
			images are displayed.</li>
		<li>/O=<i>text</i> causes the display of all other (non-image)
			information which is attached to the currently selected taxon, which
			is contained in an RTF file or is generated from Intkey commands, and
			whose subjects contain &quot;<i>text</i>&quot;. If &quot;=<i>text</i>&quot;
			is omitted, all such information is displayed, regardless of subject.</li>
		<li>/X causes the &quot;information&quot; dialog to be closed
			when operations specified in other switches are complete.</li>
	</ul>
