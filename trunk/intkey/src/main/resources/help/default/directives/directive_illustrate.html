	<h2>ILLUSTRATE</h2>
	<p>This command displays illustrations of characters or taxa (if
		available). Images of any size, and containing any number of colours
		or grey levels, can be displayed, but the results will usually be poor
		if Windows is running in a 16-colour mode (see &quot;Hardware&quot;
		under &quot;Introduction&quot; for more information). Various options
		are available through the menu system in the illustration window.
		Ctrl+DownArrow and Ctrl+UpArrow move between illustrations of the same
		character or taxon, and Ctrl+PageDown and Ctrl+PageUp move between
		illustrations of different characters or taxa. This can also be done
		via the menus. A bell indicates that there are no more illustrations.
		Ctrl+End displays all the remaining illustrations (of those specified
		in the command). Esc interrupts this display. &quot;+&quot; increases
		and &quot;&#45;&quot; decreases the length of time each image is
		displayed. See also Keywords.</p>
