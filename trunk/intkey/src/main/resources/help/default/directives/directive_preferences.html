	<h2>PREFERENCES</h2>
	This command displays a dialog box for selecting an input file (see
	FILE INPUT) specifying preferred parameter settings. This input file is
	executed immediately, and again after the initialization file
	(INTKEY.INI) of each new data set. The default file type is .PRF, and
	the default directory is the one containing the program. The settings
	associated with the operating mode initially selected by the user (see
	&quot;Modes of Operation&quot;, under &quot;Introduction&quot;) are
	also reset at the start of each new data set. The order of setting
	parameters is: initialization file, operating mode, preferences file.
	You can also specify a preferences file to be automatically invoked
	when the program starts: see &quot;Data-Sets Index and Startup
	Parameters&quot; under &quot;Introduction&quot;.
	<h3>Example of &quot;preferences&quot; file</h3>
