	<h2>INCLUDE</h2>
	<p>This command is used to specify the set of characters or taxa on
		which subsequent commands operate. If another command also specifies
		ranges of characters or taxa, the ones used are normally those
		specified in both the current command and the last INCLUDE command.
		For example, INCLUDE CHARACTERS 1&#45;5 9&#45;20 followed by
		CHARACTERS 5&#45;10 would display characters 5, 9, and 10. However,
		the INCLUDE command completely overrides previous INCLUDE commands.
		The currently INCLUDEd characters or taxa can be overridden in any
		command by means of a checkbox in the keyword selection dialog box.
		The same thing can be achieved on the command line by means of the
		switch /C (for characters) and /T (for taxa). Example: DESC REMAINING
		/C ALL will display a complete description regardless of which
		characters are currently INCLUDEd. See also EXCLUDE, Keywords.</p>
