	<h2>OUTPUT</h2>
	<p>This command is available only if an OUTPUT file (see FILE
		OUTPUT) has been opened. It provides alternative versions of the
		commands CHARACTERS, TAXA, DESCRIBE, SUMMARY, DIAGNOSE, DIFFERENCES,
		SIMILARITIES, and COMMENT. These versions format the output
		differently (in formats designed for input to other programs).</p>
	<p>OUTPUT commands, except for COMMENT, normally output a heading
		identical with the first two words of the command. This heading is
		suppressed if the preceding command was an OUTPUT COMMENT command.
		This enables the construction of complete directives for other
		programs. For example, &quot;OUTPUT COMMENT *INCLUDE ITEMS&quot;
		followed by &quot;OUTPUT TAXA REMAINING&quot; would produce an INCLUDE
		ITEMS directive suitable for CONFOR.</p>

		<i>Syntax of command line:</i> OUTPUT <i>option parameters</i>
	</p>


	<h3>
		OUTPUT CHARACTERS <i>parameters</i>
	</h3>
	<p>The same as the CHARACTERS command, except that the output

		used to generate INCLUDE or EXCLUDE CHARACTERS directives for CONFOR.</p>

	<h3>
		OUTPUT TAXA <i>parameters</i>
	</h3>
	<p>The same as the TAXA command, except that the output consists
		only of the specified taxon numbers. This command can be used to
		generate INCLUDE or EXCLUDE ITEMS directives for CONFOR.</p>

	<h3>
		OUTPUT DESCRIBE <i>parameters</i>
	</h3>
	<p>The same as the DESCRIBE command, except that the output is in
		DELTA format.</p>

	<h3>
		OUTPUT SUMMARY <i>parameters</i>
	</h3>
	<p>The same as the SUMMARY command, except that the output is in
		DELTA format.</p>

	<h3>
		OUTPUT DIAGNOSE <i>parameters</i>
	</h3>
	<p>The same as the DIAGNOSE command, except that the output is in a
		format suitable for the CONFOR directives ADD or EMPHASIZE CHARACTERS.</p>

	<h3>
		OUTPUT DIFFERENCES <i>parameters</i>
	</h3>
	<p>The same as the DIFFERENCES command, except that the output
		consists only of the character numbers for which the taxa are
		different. This command can be used to generate INCLUDE or EXCLUDE
		CHARACTERS directives for CONFOR.</p>

	<h3>
		OUTPUT SIMILARITIES <i>parameters</i>
	</h3>
	<p>The same as the SIMILARITIES command, except that the output
		consists only of the character numbers for which the taxa are similar.
		This command can be used to generate INCLUDE or EXCLUDE CHARACTERS
		directives for CONFOR.</p>

	<h3>
		OUTPUT COMMENT <i>text</i>
	</h3>
	<p>The same as the COMMENT command, except that the text is written
