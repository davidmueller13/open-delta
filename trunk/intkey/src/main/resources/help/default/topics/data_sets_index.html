	<h2>Data-sets and data-set index</h2>
	<p>Data sets are normally selected from the 'Select data set'
		dialog box, which the program displays on startup or when the New Data
		Set option of the &quot;File&quot; menu is invoked.</p>
	<p>The first time you use a particular dataset, you must specify
		its 'initialization file', which is usually called intkey.ini or
		intkey.ink. You can enter the name of this file directly, or find it
		by using the 'Browse' button.</p>
	<p>After you have finished using the dataset, you can add it to the
		dataset index, and when you want to use it again, you can select it
		from the index via the 'Select by title' list in the 'Select data set'
		dialog box.</p>
	<p>In advanced mode, the 'Edit Data Set Index' dialog box can be
		used to add, delete and edit items in the data set index. It can also
		be used to change the ordering of the items in the data set index.</p>
