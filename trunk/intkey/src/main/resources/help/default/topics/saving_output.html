	<h2>Saving Output</h2>
	Program output can be saved in files, or copied to the clipboard and
	pasted into other applications. Output from commands such as
	&quot;Describe&quot;, &quot;Diagnose&quot;, and &quot;Differences&quot;
	is normally displayed in separate windows. The contents of these
	windows can be printed, saved, or copied to the clipboard by the usual
	Windows mechanisms. The contents of the &quot;log&quot;, which can be
	displayed by means of the command &quot;Display Log On&quot; in the
	&quot;Settings&quot; menu, can also be printed, saved, or copied to the
	clipboard by the usual Windows mechanisms; they can also be
	saved via the &quot;File Log&quot; command in the &quot;File&quot;
	menu. The &quot;File Output&quot; and &quot;Output&quot; commands in
	the &quot;File&quot; menu produce output in special formats for input
	to other programs.
