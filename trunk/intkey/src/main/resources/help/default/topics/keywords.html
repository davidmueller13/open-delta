	<h2>Keywords</h2>
	A keyword is a word or phrase associated with a group of characters or
	taxa. The keyword can be used to refer to those characters or taxa
	(instead of using a list of character or taxon numbers). The set of
	characters or taxa denoted by a keyword is normally restricted to the
	&quot;included&quot; characters or taxa. See the &quot;Include&quot;
	command for details and an example. Keywords are defined by means of
	the &quot;Define&quot; command. Most sets of data will incorporate
	keywords defined by the person who prepared the data. You can add
	further definitions for your own convenience. Several keywords are
	predefined by the program itself. The actual sets of characters and
	taxa defined by these may change as you use certain commands. Four
	character keywords are predefined:
	<ul>
		<li>all &#45; all the (included) characters;</li>
		<li>none &#45; none of the characters;</li>
		<li>used &#45; the characters used in the current identification;</li>
		<li>available &#45; the characters still usable in the current
			identification (characters which have not been used, and which are
			not inapplicable because of a dependency on used characters).</li>
	</ul>
	Five taxon keywords are predefined:
	<ul>
		<li>all &#45; all the (included) taxa;</li>
		<li>none &#45; none of the taxa;</li>
		<li>remaining &#45; the taxa remaining in the current
			identification;</li>
		<li>eliminated &#45; the taxa eliminated from the current
			identification.</li>
		<li>selected &#45; the taxa currently selected in the
			&quot;Taxa&quot; panes of the main window.</li>
	</ul>
