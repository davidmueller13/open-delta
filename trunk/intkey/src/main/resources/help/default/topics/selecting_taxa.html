	<h2>Selecting taxa</h2>
	<p>The taxa on which an operation is to be carried out (for
		example, displaying the differences between taxa) may be selected in
		the &quot;Taxa&quot; (right-hand) panes of the main window before
		specifying the operation. In Advanced mode, other selection methods
		are also available (see &quot;Dialog Boxes and List Boxes&quot;).</p>
	<p>The &quot;Remaining Taxa&quot; and &quot;Eliminated Taxa&quot;
		lists behave as a single list when taxa are being selected. Clicking
		on a taxon selects that taxon and deselects all others. Multiple taxa
		can be selected in the usual ways, that is, by holding down the Shift
		and/or Ctrl keys while clicking.</p>
	<p>The &quot;Find text in taxon names&quot; button in the
		&quot;Taxa&quot; toolbar allows you to search for text in the taxon
		names in the &quot;Taxa&quot; panes. The authorities are also
		searched, although they are not normally displayed in these panes. The
		names found are selected, allowing them to be used in subsequent
		operations (for example, in requesting information about the taxa). By
		default, all the matching names are selected; &quot;Next&quot; and
		&quot;Previous&quot; buttons allow all the selections to be seen, if
		they cannot all be displayed together. Clicking the radio button
		&quot;Select one&quot; cause the names to be selected one by one; the
		&quot;Next&quot; and &quot;Previous&quot; buttons then move the
		selection to the next or previous matching name.</p>
	<p>By default, only the names in the &quot;Remaining Taxa&quot;
		(top-right) pane) are searched. Check boxes allow the search to be
		extended to the &quot;Eliminated Taxa&quot; (bottom-right) pane and to
		the synonyms (if available).</p>
