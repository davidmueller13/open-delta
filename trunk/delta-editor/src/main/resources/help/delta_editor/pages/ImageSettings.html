<h2><a name="_The_Image_Settings"></a>The Image Settings Dialog</h2>

<p style="page-break-after: avoid;">This dialog is provided to change settings related to
    display of images and their text overlays. It is opened either by choosing
    &#39;View &gt; Image settings&#39; from the menu; by clicking on the &#39;Settings&#39; button
    of the images panel of the Item Editor or Character Editor windows; or by
    right-clicking the mouse on an image file name in an images panel or a
    displayed image and selecting &#39;Image settings&#39; from the resulting menu. Here is
    an example.</p>

<p class="image"><img src="delta-ed_files/delta-ed-45.png" alt="'Image settings' dialog." border="0"></p>

<p>The left portion of this dialog selects default
    characteristics to be applied to newly created text overlays on images.
    Changing these settings generally has no effect on existing overlays. An
    exception is that changing &#39;Button alignment&#39; will affect existing push-button
    overlays if those overlays are later edited or repositioned on their image. For
    more detailed information on the meaning of these settings, see the section
    below on Image Windows and Overlays.</p>

<p class="MsoFooter">An edit control in the upper right portion of this dialog
    contains the &#39;image path&#39;. This is a list of directories in which the program
    will look for image or sound files. Multiple directories are separated with a
    semicolon. For example, an image path of &#39;.;images;e:\&#39; will cause the program
    to search for images in the current directory (that is, the directory in which
    the &#39;.dlt&#39; file itself resides), the subdirectory &#39;images&#39; of the current
    directory, and the root directory of the E: drive. Components of the image path
    may be URL&#39;s, e.g., http://delta-intkey.com/angio/images. The &#39;Browse&#39; button
    can be used to locate directories on the local machine to be added to the image
    path. URL&#39;s must be entered manually.</p>

<p class="MsoFooter">The lower left portion of the dialog provides a mechanism
    for setting the fonts to be used for image overlays. The &#39;default&#39; font is used
    for most text overlays. The &#39;feature&#39; font is used for the display of feature
    description overlays; if it is not set explicitly, the &#39;default&#39; font is used.
    The &#39;button&#39; font is used for the &#39;OK&#39;, &#39;Cancel&#39;, and &#39;Notes&#39; buttons. Changes
    to these values will affect all existing overlays, as well as those yet to be
    created. A sample of each font is displayed as changes are made.</p>

<p>Note that changes made within this dialog do not take effect
    immediately. You must click either the &#39;Apply&#39; button or &#39;OK&#39; button (which
    also closes the dialog) for any changes to be applied.</p>
