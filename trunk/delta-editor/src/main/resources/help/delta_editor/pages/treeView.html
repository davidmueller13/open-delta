    <title>The Tree View Attribute Editor</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1><a name="_The_tree-view_attribute_1"></a>The tree-view attribute editor</h1>

<p style="page-break-after: avoid;">The tree view attribute editor is the default means of
    viewing the data. Here is an example.</p>

<p class="image"><img src="delta-ed_files/delta-ed-36.png" alt="sample.dlt - Attribute Edit (Trees)" border="0"></p>

<p>The window is divided into four panes, which can be resized
    by the user as desired by clicking on and dragging the boundaries between them.</p>

<p><a name="itemTree"><i>The Item Tree (top-left pane).</i></a>
    This contains a list of the names and numbers of all items
    (taxa) in the data set. To select an item as the &#39;current&#39; item for the window,
    click on it (i.e. on its name or number) with the left mouse button (item 3,
    Anisopogon, is the currently selected item in the example above). To move an
    item to a different position in the list, drag it with the left mouse button
    (that is, move the mouse while holding down the button). To copy (or move) an
    item, drag it with the right mouse button &#8211; a popup menu offers a choice
    between copying or moving. Clicking the right mouse button opens a popup menu
    with options for inserting, modifying or deleting items in the list.
    Double-clicking on an item will open the item editor dialog.</p>

<p>(The reader might wonder why this pane is called the item <i>tree</i> when it appears to be a simple <i>list</i> of items. In future versions of the
    program, it will be possible to group items hierarchically. When that is
    implemented, a tree structure will be used for navigating the hierarchy.)</p>

<p><a name="characterTree"><i>The Character Tree (top-right pane).</i></a> The upper-level nodes of this tree consist of a list of
    the feature descriptions of all characters in the data set. An icon to the left
    of the feature description indicates the character type &#8211; whether <b>T</b>ext, <b>I</b>nteger numeric, <b>R</b>eal
    numeric, <b>U</b>nordered multistate, or <b>O</b>rdered multistate. When a node is
    expanded, it reveals either (for text and numeric characters, such as character
    8 in the example above) a text box giving the value of that character for the
    selected item (and possibly the units of measurement); or (for multistate
    characters, such as characters 10 and 11 in the example above) a list of the
    states defined for that character.</p>

<p>To select a character as the &#39;current&#39; character for the
    window, click on it (anywhere in its feature or state description) with the
    left mouse button (character 11 is the currently selected character in the
    example above). To move a character to a different position in the list, drag
    its feature description with the left mouse button. To move a state within its
    character, drag the state description with the left mouse button. Clicking the
    right mouse button opens a popup menu with options for inserting, modifying or
    deleting characters and their states. Double-clicking on a character will open
    the character editor dialog.</p>

<p>For multistate characters, a check box appears to the left
    of each state description. If a tick is present in the box, it indicates that
    the state applies to the currently selected item. A smaller, grey tick
    indicates that the state is present by implication, rather than explicit coding
    (see character 10 in the example). If the background colour of the box is
    white, the application of that state to the currently selected item may be
    toggled by clicking on the box.</p>

<p>A white background in a character-value box, as in
    characters 8 and 10 in the example, indicates that the attribute is &#39;simple&#39;,
    and the value(s) can be edited <i>in situ</i>.
    A grey background, as in character 11 in the example, indicates that the
    attribute is &#39;complex&#39;, defined as follows.</p>

<ul><li><i>Text characters</i>. The attribute has
    embedded formatting information.</li>
    <li><i>Numeric characters</i>. The attribute
        includes comments, extreme values (enclosed in parentheses), or delimiters
        other than &#39;&#8211;&#39; (&#39;to&#39;).</li>
    <li><i>Multistate characters</i>. The attribute
        includes comments, or delimiters other than &#39;/&#39; (&#39;or&#39;); or the states within
        the attribute are not in ascending order.</li></ul>

<p class="margint0">Complex attributes can be edited or entered only in the
    complex-attribute editing pane &#8211; see below.</p>

<p>If a character is inapplicable because of dependency
    relationships, a diagonal red bar appears across both the &#39;type&#39; icon and the
    state check boxes.</p>

<p><a name="complexAttributeEditor"><i>The Complex-Attribute Editor (lower-left pane).</i></a>
     This pane is a rich edit control &#8211; that is, it
    allows display and editing of formatting marks. It contains the DELTA encoding
    for the currently selected item and character, using the traditional DELTA
    style. Angle brackets should appear around comments, but should <i>not</i> be placed around text attributes. A
    toolbar above the pane provides controls for rendering portions of the text in
    bold, italics, etc., and for undoing changes. Error checking is performed when
    the input focus leaves the edit control.</p>

<p><a name="stateListAttributeEditor"><i>The State List (bottom-right pane).</i></a>
    If the currently selected character is a text or
    numeric character, this pane contains only an icon denoting the character type,
    and the units of measurement (if applicable). If the currently selected
    character is a multistate character, it contains a list of the states of the
    character, with a check box next to each. The appearance and method of use of
    the check boxes is the same as in the character-tree pane. This pane is
    provided so that the codings may be viewed and edited when the character is not
    &#39;expanded&#39; in the character-tree pane.</p>
