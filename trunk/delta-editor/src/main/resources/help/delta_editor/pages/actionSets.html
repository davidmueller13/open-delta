<h1>The Action Sets Dialog</h1>
<p>Action sets are sets of instructions that will be read and
    processed by various programs, in order to produce output such as
    natural-language descriptions, or to carry out pre-defined operations in the
    interactive identification program, Intkey. Templates for various commonly used
    action sets are automatically included when a new dataset is created as
    described above. These templates are based on a subset of the action sets
    included in the sample data supplied with the programs (see <a href="delta-ed.htm#_Experimenting_with_the">Experimenting with the Sample Data</a>). The
    sample data contain references to taxon names and to character and state
    numbers that will usually be inconsistent with or inappropriate for another
    data set. Rather than deleting directives containing such information, they
    have been turned into comments, in order to serve as examples.</p>

<h3>Heading (Action set:)</h3>
The &#39;Action set:&#39; label displays a description of the selected action set (or directive file).  This description is
derived from the presence of a COMMENT or SHOW directive in the file contents.  It identifies the action set that
the buttons on the right hand side of the screen will act upon.

<h3>Tabs (Confor, Intkey, Dist, Key)</h3>
The tabs below the heading label sort the action sets into groups defined by the DELTA program that will be
used if the action set is activated by use of the 'Run' button.
The behaviour of these programs are described in the <a href="delta-user-guide.htm">DELTA user guide</a>.

<h3>The main table</h3>
The action-set descriptions shown in the column labelled
    &#39;Action&#39; are taken from a &#39;COMMENT&#39; or &#39;SHOW&#39; directive at the start of each
    action set. The text in the &#39;File name&#39; column is the internal file name of the
    action set, and also the name of the corresponding external file when the data
    are exported to DELTA text files. The &#39;Imported/exported&#39; column show the date
    and time when the action set was most recently imported from or exported to its
    external counterpart.

<p>The sets whose descriptions start with &#39;~&#39; are partial sets,
    which are incapable of producing output by themselves, but are invoked by other
    action sets.</p>

<h3>The action buttons</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Run</em> - executes the selected action set using the appropriate program.</li>
    <li><em>Add</em> - creates a new action set and displays the <a href="actionSetEditor.html">Action Set Editor</a>
        to allow it's contents to be edited..</li>
    <li><em>Edit</em> - displays the <a href="actionSetEditor.html">Action Set Editor</a> to allow the contents of the
    selected action set to be edited.</li>
    <li><em>Delete</em> - removes the selected action set from the data set.</li>
    <li><em>Done</em> - closes the Action Sets Dialog.</li>

  </ul>
