*CHARACTER NOTES
#1. The data would be improved by inclusion of nomenclatural
  references. At present, they are given only for genera not covered by Clayton
  and Renvoize (1986).
#4. ‘Annual’: plants progressing from germination to seed production and
  perishing, within that period. \par{}‘Biennial’ (not known in grasses?): a
  plant normally requiring two years to complete its life-cycle, growing
  vegetatively in the first, then flowering, fruiting and perishing in the
  second. \par{}‘Perennial’: a plant which persists and continues growth for
  several to many years. Detectable in herbaceous grasses by the shrivelled
  remnants of old sheaths and culms.
#13. In the absence of a suite of characters to deal satisfactorily with general
  inflorescence form, this has to suffice. Note that the coded data are
  frequently supplemented by important data comments, and forms for which these
  states are inappropriate are described exclusively via comments.
#19. Currently a catch-all character, covering one-sidedness of inflorescence;
  e.g. \i{}Dactylis\i0{}, dorsiventral rachides, etc.
#26. Data unreliable for large genera.
#31. An unsatisfactory catch-all character, but widely recorded and useful in
  keys.
#68. ‘Maximum cells-distant count’: the maximum number of cells separating any
  individual chlorenchymatous mesophyll or photosynthetic carbon assimilation
  (PCA) cell from the nearest parenchymatous bundle sheath (PBS) or
  photosynthetic carbon reduction (PCR) cell. This parameter defines the
  relatively unambiguous ‘one cell distant criterion’, whereby
  C\sub{}3\nosupersub{} and C\sub{}4\nosupersub{} forms are reliably and easily
  distinguished. By contrast, C\sub{}3\nosupersub{}/C\sub{}4\nosupersub{}
  assignments by ‘radiateness’ of chlorenchyma, or by recognition of
  ‘Kranz’/‘non-Kranz’ anatomy, are less satisfactory: ‘radiateness’ is ambiguous
  and is often misleading, and many C\sub{}4\nosupersub{} leaves
  (\i{}Arundinella\i0{}, \i{}Triodia\i0{} etc.) do not exhibit typical ‘Kranz’
  anatomy. \par{}The terms PCA (primary carbon assimilation) and PCR
  (photosynthetic carbon reduction: containing Rubisco) are applicable to the
  cells and tissues of C\sub{}4\nosupersub{} forms only. For these, the term PCR
  is preferable to ‘Kranz’, since it is directly indicative of physiological
  function, and PCR cells do not always occur in ‘Kranz’ bundle sheaths.
  \par{}For detailed discussion, see Hattersley and Watson (1975) and Hattersley
  \i{}et al\i0{}. (1977).
#69. See Hatch and Kagawa 1974, Gutierrez et al. 1974(a) and 1974(b), Hatch,
  Kagawa and Craig 1975, and Prendergast, Hattersley and Stone 1987. Species
  samples in parentheses.
#70. Refers to the presence (XyMS+) or absence (XyMS–) of cells between the
  metaxylem vessel elements and laterally adjacent chlorenchymatous bundle
  sheath (CBS, ‘Kranz’ or PCR: C\sub{}4\nosupersub{}) or parenchymatous bundle
  sheath (PBS: C\sub{}3\nosupersub{}) cells in the primary lateral vascular
  bundles (i.e. in the largest bundles exhibiting both metaxylem and protoxylem)
  of the leaf blade (see Hattersley and Watson 1976). When properly applied,
  this unambiguous criterion reliably distinguishes NADP-ME species (XyMS–) from
  PCK and NAD-ME species (both XyMS+). The terms MS (mestome sheath) and PS
  (parenchymatous sheath) of Brown (1975, 1977) refer to the supposed homologies
  of photosynthetic carbon reduction (PCR, ‘Kranz’) sheaths in
  C\sub{}4\nosupersub{} forms. The MS condition is identified by XyMS–, the PS
  one by XyMS+. Dengler \i{}et al\i0{}. (1985) provide comparative ontological
  evidence in support of the MS/PS hypothesis. \par{}For recent detailed
  discussion of C\sub{}4\nosupersub{} anatomical tissue configurations and
  physiological types, see Hattersley (1992) and Hattersley and Watson (1993).
#71. All the leaf anatomical data in these descriptions refer to preparations
  made from the mid-zone of the laminae of ‘normal’, mature leaves. To obtain
  reliably comparative data, avoid seedling and flag leaves, culm leaves with
  blades reduced or missing, and conspicuously unhealthy material. Attempted
  identification of leaf fragments should be conducted with these sampling
  considerations in mind, and the results qualified accordingly. For detailed
  discussion of these matters, and further information on character state
  definitions, see Metcalfe (1960), Clifford and Watson (1977).
#72. All the leaf anatomical data in these descriptions refer to preparations

#78. Subfamilies updated from Watson \i{}et al\i0{}. (1985).
#79. Supertribes updated from Watson \i{}et al\i0{}. (1985), with name endings
  changed.
#86. The phytogeographical Kingdoms, Subkingdoms, Regions and Subregions are
  those of Takhtajan (1969). The data, which are complete, were provided by B.K.
  Simon (1987). They are intended to reflect ‘natural’ distributions, insofar as
  these are determinable.
#87. ‘This project’ denotes original observations by Watson, or for Pooideae by
  Macfarlane (1979) supplemented by Watson. Taxonomic realignments (extensive in
  Triticeae) have been accounted for when using Metcalfe (1960).
